# Git & GitHub Collaboration Guide for Software Development Teams

This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to using Git and GitHub for team collaboration. It covers essential concepts, a standard workflow, and instructions for both command-line users and those preferring the VS Code interface.

## 1. Introduction: What are Git & GitHub?

* **Git:** A distributed version control system (VCS). Think of it as a "save" system for your code that tracks every change made over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. It runs locally on your computer.
* **GitHub:** A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It adds features on top of Git, such as issue tracking, pull requests (for code review), project management tools, and a central place for your team to store and share code.

**Why use them?**

* **Collaboration:** Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase efficiently.
* **Version History:** Tracks every change, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
* **Branching:** Lets developers work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase until ready.
* **Code Review:** Facilitates reviewing code changes before they are merged into the main project (via Pull Requests).
* **Backup:** GitHub acts as a remote backup for your codebase.

## 2. Core Git Concepts

* **Repository (Repo):** A folder containing your project's code and the entire history of changes (.git hidden folder). Can be local (on your machine) or remote (on GitHub).
* **Commit:** A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes made.
* **Branch:** An independent line of development. The default branch is usually called `main` (or sometimes `master`). You create new branches to work on features or fixes without disturbing the main branch.
* **Merge:** Combining changes from one branch into another.
* **Clone:** Creating a local copy of a remote repository (from GitHub) onto your computer.
* **Fork:** Creating a personal copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. Useful for contributing to open-source projects.
* **Remote:** A reference to a repository hosted on a server (like GitHub). The default remote is usually called `origin`.
* **HEAD:** A pointer indicating your current location in the repository's history (usually points to the latest commit on your current branch).
* **Staging Area (Index):** A holding area where you prepare changes before committing them. You `add` files to the staging area.
* **Pull Request (PR):** A request on GitHub to merge changes from one branch (e.g., your feature branch) into another (e.g., the `main` branch). This is where code review happens.

## 3. Setting Up

1.  **Install Git:** Download and install Git from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.
2.  **Configure Git:** Open your terminal or command prompt and set your username and email (use the same email as your GitHub account):
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
3.  **Create a GitHub Account:** Sign up at <https://github.com/>.
4.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    * Log in to GitHub.
    * Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
    * Give it a name, description (optional), choose Public or Private.
    * **Important:** Initialize it with a README file (recommended).
    * Click "Create repository".

## 4. A Common Team Workflow (Feature Branch Workflow)

This is a simplified but effective workflow:

1.  **Start with `main`:** The `main` branch should always contain stable, deployable code. No one pushes directly to `main`.
2.  **Clone the Repo:** Get a local copy of the project from GitHub.
3.  **Keep `main` Updated:** Before starting new work, always update your local `main` branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
4.  **Create a Feature Branch:** For every new feature or bug fix, create a new branch *from* the `main` branch. Name it descriptively (e.g., `feature/user-login`, `fix/navbar-bug`).
5.  **Work on the Feature Branch:** Make your code changes, test them, and commit them regularly on this branch.
6.  **Push the Feature Branch:** Push your local feature branch to the remote repository (GitHub).
7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):** On GitHub, create a PR to merge your feature branch into the `main` branch. Assign reviewers from your team.
8.  **Code Review:** Team members review the code in the PR, provide feedback, and request changes if necessary.
9.  **Merge the PR:** Once approved, the PR is merged into the `main` branch (usually done on GitHub).
10. **Delete the Feature Branch:** After merging, the feature branch can often be deleted (both locally and remotely).
11. **Repeat:** Pull the updated `main` branch locally and start the process again for the next task.

## 5. Using Git with the Command Line (CLI)

Open your terminal or command prompt in your project directory.

* **Clone a Repository:**
    ```bash
    # Replace <repository_url> with the URL from GitHub (HTTPS or SSH)
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory> # Navigate into the cloned folder
    ```
* **Check Status:** See which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
* **View History:** See the commit history.
    ```bash
    git log
    git log --oneline --graph --decorate # A more concise view
    ```
* **Create a New Branch:**
    ```bash
    # Creates a new branch based on your current branch (usually main)
    git branch <new_branch_name>
    ```
* **Switch to a Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch_name>
    # Or create and switch in one command:
    git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
    ```
* **Pull Latest Changes:** Update your current local branch with changes from the remote repository. **Do this often, especially on `main`!**
    ```bash
    # Fetches changes from 'origin' (remote) for the current branch and merges them
    git pull origin <branch_name>
    # If tracking is set up (common after cloning or pushing), you can often just use:
    git pull
    ```
* **Stage Changes:** Add specific files or all changes to the staging area.
    ```bash
    # Stage a specific file
    git add <file_name>
    # Stage all modified and new files in the current directory and subdirectories
    git add .
    ```
* **Commit Changes:** Save the staged changes to your local repository history.
    ```bash
    # Write a concise, descriptive commit message
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    ```
* **Push Changes:** Upload your local commits from your current branch to the remote repository (GitHub).
    ```bash
    # Push the current branch to the remote named 'origin'
    git push origin <branch_name>
    # If pushing a branch for the first time, you might need:
    git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
    # Subsequent pushes on the same branch can often just use:
    git push
    ```
* **Merge Branches:** Combine changes from another branch into your *current* branch.
    ```bash
    # 1. Make sure you are on the receiving branch (e.g., main)
    git checkout main
    # 2. Pull the latest changes for the receiving branch
    git pull origin main
    # 3. Merge the feature branch into your current branch (main)
    git merge <feature_branch_name>
    # 4. Push the merge commit (if merging locally, often done via PR on GitHub)
    git push origin main
    ```
    *Note: Merging directly into `main` locally is often discouraged in team workflows; use Pull Requests on GitHub instead.*

* **Delete a Local Branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch -d <branch_name> # Safe delete (only if merged)
    git branch -D <branch_name> # Force delete
    ```
* **Delete a Remote Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin --delete <branch_name>
    ```

## 6. Using Git with VS Code Source Control

VS Code has excellent built-in Git integration.

1.  **Open the Source Control View:** Click the icon that looks like branching lines in the Activity Bar on the left (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
2.  **Clone a Repository:**
    * Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    * Type `Git: Clone` and press Enter.
    * Paste the repository URL from GitHub.
    * Choose a local directory to save the repository.
    * VS Code will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Click "Open".
3.  **Viewing Changes:**
    * The Source Control view lists modified files under "Changes".
    * Clicking a file shows a diff view (comparing the working copy with the last commit).
4.  **Staging Changes:**
    * Hover over a file in the "Changes" list and click the `+` (Stage Changes) icon.
    * Alternatively, click the `+` icon next to the "Changes" heading to stage all changes. Staged files move to the "Staged Changes" section.
5.  **Committing Changes:**
    * Type your commit message in the input box at the top of the Source Control view.
    * Click the checkmark icon (Commit) or press `Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Enter` on Mac).
6.  **Creating and Switching Branches:**
    * Click the current branch name in the bottom-left status bar.
    * A dropdown appears at the top. Select `+ Create new branch...` or choose an existing branch to switch to (`checkout`).
7.  **Pushing Changes:**
    * After committing, click the "Synchronize Changes" button (usually shows arrows pointing up/down) in the status bar or next to the branch name in the Source Control view. This will pull remote changes first (if any) and then push your local commits.
    * Alternatively, click the `...` menu in the Source Control view, go to `Push, Pull`, and select `Push`.
8.  **Pulling Changes:**
    * Click the "Synchronize Changes" button in the status bar.
    * Or, click the `...` menu, go to `Push, Pull`, and select `Pull`.
9.  **Handling Merge Conflicts:**
    * If `git pull` or merging results in conflicts, VS Code highlights the conflicted files.
    * Open the file. VS Code shows conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
    * VS Code provides inline options like "Accept Current Change", "Accept Incoming Change", "Accept Both Changes", "Compare Changes".
    * Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict, removing the markers.
    * Stage the resolved file.
    * Commit the merge.
10. **Creating Pull Requests:** While you can install the "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension for full PR management within VS Code, the simplest way is often:
    * Push your feature branch using VS Code.
    * Go to your repository on GitHub.com. GitHub will usually show a prompt to create a Pull Request for the recently pushed branch. Click it and follow the instructions.

## 7. Best Practices for Team Collaboration

* **Communicate:** Talk to your team about who is working on what to avoid conflicts.
* **Pull Frequently:** Update your local `main` branch and feature branches often (`git pull`) to integrate changes from others and reduce merge conflicts.
* **Commit Often:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages. Don't wait until you've changed hundreds of lines.
* **Write Good Commit Messages:** Follow a consistent style (e.g., start with a verb in the imperative mood: "Fix login bug", "Add user profile page"). Explain *why* the change was made, not just *what* changed.
* **Use Descriptive Branch Names:** `feature/add-login`, `fix/header-layout`.
* **Write Clear PR Descriptions:** Explain the purpose of the PR, link to relevant issues, and mention specific areas for reviewers to focus on.
* **Perform Thorough Code Reviews:** Provide constructive feedback. Check for correctness, style, potential bugs, and adherence to project standards.
* **Don't Push Directly to `main`:** Always use feature branches and Pull Requests. Protect the `main` branch in your GitHub repository settings if possible.
* **Resolve Conflicts Promptly:** Address merge conflicts as soon as they arise. Ask for help if you're unsure.
